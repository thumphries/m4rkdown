# m4rkdown

**Warning: This is pre-release software. You should probably not use
  it. Features described below may be incomplete.**

`m4rkdown` extends CommonMark with a terrible macro system.

These can be defined in Haskell or as simple text replacement.

It is intended to allow you to build convoluted authoring systems on
top of standard Markdown syntax. This may or may not be a good idea.

The project is named after M4, the venerable macro processing
system. It does not really resemble M4, besides being an overpowered
tool for undisciplined hackery.
